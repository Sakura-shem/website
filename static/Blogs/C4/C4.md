The C4 means China Collegiate Computing Contest. To be honesty, it's a water Contest. The offical only request demo video and source before the final. You can get a decent prize just by slacking if you demo video is well.
Unfortunately, My party is unwound. Although I think I am work hard, I get a area prize. 
As far as I know, the quality of the Contest seem to be imporving.

# About
The core of ours project is to get people tired state. <br>

Firstly, we get person voice info, EGG, pulse and blinking frequency by some sensors. By the way, all bought in TB. <br>

Secondly, we quantify the data from sensor to minute.
Here is an example.

> Pulse: 60 / min <br>
> Blinking Frequency: 15 / min <br>
> Voice: High / Low / Very Low
> EGG: Actually, I can't use it to get some signal. you know ~

Thirdly, we use the fuzzy decision-making tree to deal data and output result.  <br>

Fourth, we showing the result by webpage.

[Here is specific project description](./src/project%20description.pdf)

# Sources
The project is a collaboration of six students from Jilin university. <br>
